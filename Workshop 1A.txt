WORKSHOP 1A

1. 
IF total_sales IS NULL THEN 
    total_sales := 0; 
END IF;
   
Answer:
   
CASE 
WHEN total_sales IS NULL THEN
   total_sales :=0;
END CASE
   
2. Rewrite the following IF statement to get rid of unnecessary nested IFs: 

IF salary < 10000 THEN 
    bonus := 2000; 
ELSIF salary < 20000 THEN 
    bonus := 1500; 
ELSIF salary < 40000 THEN 
    bonus := 1000; 
ELSE bonus := 500; 
END IF; 
---END IF; 
---END IF;

3. Which procedure will never be executed in this IF statement?

IF (order_date > SYSDATE) THEN 
	fill_order (order_id, 'HIGH PRIORITY'); 
ELSIF (order_date < SYSDATE) OR (order_date = SYSDATE) THEN 
	fill_order (order_id, 'LOW PRIORITY'); 
ELSIF order_date <= SYSDATE THEN 
	---queue_order_for_addtl_parts (order_id); 
ELSIF order_total = 0 THEN 
END IF;

4. How many times does the following loop execute?

BEGIN
  FOR i IN REVERSE 12..1 LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (i);
  END LOOP;
END;
/
5. Identify the problems with (or areas for improvement in) the following loops. How would you change the loop to improve it?

BEGIN
  FOR i IN 1..76 LOOP 
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (i);
  END LOOP;
END;
/

6. Identify the problems with (or areas for improvement in) the following loops. How would you change the loop to improve it?

DECLARE
a_counter NUMBER :=10;
lo_val NUMBER :=2;
hi_val NUMBER :=5;
BEGIN
    FOR a_counter IN (lo_val)..(hi_val) LOOP 
        IF a_counter > lo_val * 2 THEN 
            hi_val := lo_val; 
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (a_counter);
        END IF; 
    END LOOP;
END;
